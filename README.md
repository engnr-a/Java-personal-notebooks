# Java-personal-notebooks
## About
This repository contains my personal notes from Java courses and books I have gone through.

It is intended as a quick reference guide as well as a tool for revision. 

The repository is mainly **.md** files of Java codes, textual explanations, and backup images. I hope someone might find the content of the repository useful. 
This is the essence of making the repository public. However, it should be noted that the contents are mostly in my own words and I am unable to guarantee their absolute
accuracy.
